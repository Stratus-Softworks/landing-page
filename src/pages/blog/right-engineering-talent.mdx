# Your Team Doesn’t Need More Engineers—It Needs the Right Ones

When projects start slipping or systems struggle to scale, the instinct is often to hire more engineers. But adding more people isn’t always the answer.

The truth? **What your team needs isn’t more hands—it’s more impact.**

---

## Why More Isn’t Always Better

Simply hiring more engineers can lead to:

- **Higher Costs**: Salaries, onboarding, and long-term commitments add up quickly.
- **More Complexity**: Larger teams require more coordination, slowing progress.
- **Diminishing Returns**: Without strong leadership, extra resources often create more problems than they solve.
