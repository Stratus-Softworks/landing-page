# The Hidden Costs of Underperforming Engineering Teams

Every business relies on its engineering team to deliver results. But when those teams underperform, the real costs often go unnoticed—until it’s too late.

Missed deadlines, technical debt, and lost opportunities don’t just hurt your bottom line. They hurt your ability to grow.

## The Cost of Underperformance

Underperforming teams can derail progress in several ways:

1. **Missed Deadlines**: Late projects damage customer trust and delay revenue.
2. **Technical Debt**: Quick fixes today turn into expensive rework tomorrow.
3. **Wasted Resources**: Time and money are spent solving the wrong problems.

These issues compound over time, leaving your business struggling to keep up.
