# How to Scale Your Engineering Team Without Breaking the Bank

That’s where **Fractional Engineering Teams** come in.

## Why Scaling Engineering Teams is Challenging

Traditional approaches to scaling often lead to:

- **High Costs**: Full-time hires come with long-term commitments and overhead.
- **Lengthy Timelines**: Hiring takes months—time your team doesn’t have.
- **Mismatch Risks**: The wrong hire can slow down progress and create technical debt.
